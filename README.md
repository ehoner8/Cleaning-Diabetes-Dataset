# Cleaning-Diabetes-Dataset
A project that focuses on cleaning a large dataset from diabetes patients and attempts to create a model from it.


Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008 

This dataset contains information about one hundred thousand diabetes patients across 130 hospitals. Each row contains records about the patient's physical attributes, such as height, weight and gender, and the results of some tests done on them. The label was how many days until the patient was readmitted. It was either >30 days, <30 days, or "no" for never readmitted. 


The real test of this project was cleaning up the dataset. There were many missing values, so I had to take it case-by-case and go through the documentation to see what to do with each kind of missing value. The IDs could be dropped, as could things like the payer codes, which both have lots of missing values and intuitively have no effect on the outcome. For whatever reason, the 'weight' column had 98% missing values, so that needed to be dropped. A few features, such as race, had just a few missing values, so I could replace them with "none" or "missing". Age was expressed as a range, such as "[50-60)", so I wanted to turn that into an integer that was the mean of each range. And of course, I had to one hot encode many of the categorical features. One problem was the "diag_1", "diag_2", and "diag_3" had almost 1000 unique categories, so one-hot encoding would cause the number of features to explode, which is not ideal. I decided to train my models twice, once with those 3 features and once without.



Results: This was ultimately an unsuccesful  attempt at creating an effective model to predict if a diabetes patient will return, and if so, then when. I used logistic regression, SVCs, random forests, Adaboost, and GradientBoost, all with and without the diag_1, diag_2, and diag_3 features. Still, I was never able to pass a 60% accuracy rate. What I got out of this project more so than anything else is a better understanding of how to approach the data cleaning process.
